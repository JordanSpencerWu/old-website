Productivity, put simply, is the name we give our attempts to figure out the best uses of our energy, intellect, and time as we try to seize the most meaningful rewards with the least wasted effort.

    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      <p>Motivation is more like a skill, akin to reading or writing, that can be learned and honed. People can get better at self-motivation by realizing that a prerequisite to motivation is believing we have authority over our action and surroundings. To motivate ourselves, we must feel like we are in control. When people believe they are in control, they tend to work harder and push themselves more. They are, on average, more confident and overcome setbacks faster.</p>

      <p>One way to prove to ourselves that we are in control is by making decisions. Each choice, no matter how small, reinforces the perception of control and self-efficacy. The first step in creating drive is giving people opportunities to make choices that provide them with a sense of autonomy and self-determination. Motivation is triggered by making choices that demonstrate to ourselves that we are in control. Self-motivation comes from a strong "internal locus of control", a belief they could influence their destiny through the choices they made. People with an internal locus of control tend to praise or blame themselves for success or failure, rather than assigning responsibility to things outside their influence.</p>

      <p>Internal locus of control has been linked with academic success, higher self-motivation and social maturity, lower incidence of stress and depression, and longer life span. People with an internal locus of control tend to earn more money, have more friends, stay married longer, and report greater professional success and satisfaction.</p>

      <p>Internal locus of control is a learned skill. Most of us learn it early in life. But some people's sense of self determination get suppressed by how they grow up, or experiences they've had, and they forget how much influence they can have on their own lives.</p>

      <p>We're trying to teach them that you can't just obey orders. You have to take control and figure things out for yourself. If you give people an opportunity to feel a sense of control and let them practice making choices, they can learn to exert willpower. Once people know how to make self-directed choices into a habit, motivation becomes more automatic.</p>

      <p>The choices that are most powerful in generating motivation, in other words, are decisions that do two things: They convince us we're in control and they endow our actions with larger meaning. An internal locus of control emerges when we develop a mental habit of transforming choices into meaningful choices, when we assert that we have authority over our lives.</p>

      <p>We need to prove to ourselves that our choices are meaningful. When we start a new task, or confront an unpleasant chore, we should take a moment to ask ourselves "why". Once we start asking why, those small tasks become pieces of a larger constellation of meaningful projects, goals, and values. We start to recognize how small chores can have outsized emotional rewards, because they prove to ourselves that we are making meaningful choices, that we are genuinely in control of our own lives. Self-motivation is a choice we make because it is part of something bigger and more emotionally rewarding than the immediate task that needs doing.</p>

    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      <p>Group norms is any group, over time, develops collective norms about appropriate behaviors. Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards, and unwritten rules that govern how we function.</p>

      <p>On the best teams, for instance, leaders encouraged people to speak up. Good norms shared a common attribute: They were all behaviors that created a sense of togetherness while also encouraging people to take a chance. We call it "psychological safety", a shared belief, held by members of a team, that the group is a safe place for taking risk. It is a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up. It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.</p>

      <p>A key behavior in good teams is having "high average social sensitivity", the group were skilled at intuiting how members felt based on their tone of voice, how people held themselves, and the expressions on their faces.</p>

      <p>The best tactic for establishing psychological safety is demonstration by a team leader. The teams with the highest level of psychological safety were also the ones with leaders most likely to model listening and social sensitivity. This is how psychological safety emerges: by giving everyone an equal voice and encouraging social sensitivity among teammates.</p>

    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      <p>Mental automation lets us choose, almost subconsciously, what to pay attention to and what to ignore. As automation become more common, the risks that our attention spans will fail have risen. Errors are particularly likely when people are forced to toggle between automaticity and focus.</p>

      <p>"cognitive tunneling" - a mental glitch that sometimes occurs when our rains are forced to transition abruptly from relaxed automation to panicked attention.</p>

      <p>We can learn techniques to get better at toggling between relaxation and concentration, but they require practice and a desire to remain engaged.</p>

      <p>Reactive thinking is at the core of how we allocate our attention, and in many setting, it's a tremendous asset. This is how we build habits, and its why to-do list and calendar alerts are so helpful: rather than needing to decide what to do next, we can take advantage of our reactive instincts and automatically proceed.</p>

      <p>All people rely on mental models to some degree. We all tell ourselves stories about how the world works, whether we realize we're doing it or not. People who know how to manage their attention and who habitually build robust mental models tend to earn more money and get better grades. Anyone can learn to habitually construct mental models by developing a habit of telling ourselves stories about what's going on around us, we learn to sharpen where our attention goes. If you need to improve your focus and learn to avoid distractions, take a moment to visualize, with as much detail as possible, what you are about to do. Models help us choose where to direct our attention, so we can make decisions, rather than just react.</p>

      <p>To become genuinely productive, we must take control of our attention; we must build mental models that put us firmly in charge. We have to make decisions, and that includes deciding what deserves our attention. The key is forcing yourself to think.</p>

    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      <p>Determined and focused people tend to work harder and get tasks done more promptly. They stay married longer and have deeper networks of friends. They often have higher paying jobs.</p>

      <p>Personality trait known as "the need for cognitive closure" which define as "the desire for a confident judgement on an issue, any confident judgement as compared to confusion and ambiguity." People who have a strong urge for closure are more likely to be self-disciplined and seen as leaders by their peers. An instinct to make a judgement and then stick with it forestalls needless second-guessing and prolonged debate. All of us crave closure to some degree, making a decision and moving on to the next question feels productive. It feels like progress.</p>

      <p>But there are risks associated with a high need for closure. When people begin craving the emotional satisfaction that comes from making a decision, when they require a sensation of being productive in order to stay calm, they are more likely to make hasty decisions and less likely to reconsider an unwise choice. A high need for closure has been shown to trigger close-mindedness, authoritarian impulses, and a preference for conflict over cooperation.</p>

      <p>SMART goals, these objectives had to be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and based on a timeline.</p>

      <p>High goals lead to a higher level of task performance than do easy goals or vague, abstract goals such as the exhortation to 'do one's best'. The process of making a goal specific and proving it is achievable involves figuring out the steps it requires, or shifting that goal slightly, if your initial aims turn out to be unrealistic.</p>

      <p>Making yourself break a goal into its SMART components is the difference between hoping something come true and fighting out how to do it.</p>

      <p>People respond to the conditions around them. If you're being constantly told to focus on achievable results, you're only going to think of achievable goals. You're not going to dream big. "bullet train thinking", a stretch goal using dreams to set business targets, with no real idea of how to get there. Numerous academic studies have examined the impact of stretch goals, and have consistently found that forcing people to commit to ambitious, seemingly out-of-reach objectives can spark outsized jumps in innovation and productivity.</p>

      <p>For a stretch goal to inspire, it often needs to be proved with something like the SMART system. For a stretch goal to become more than just an aspiration, we need a disciplined mindset to show us how to turn a far-off objective into a series of realistic short-term aims. Stretch goals, paired with SMART thinking, can help put the impossible within reach.</p>

    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      <p>"Toyota Production System", which was producing car of very high quality at very low cost in Japan. The Toyota Production System which in the United States would become known as "lean manufacturing", relied on pushing decision making to the lowest possible level. The system was built to exploit everyone's expertise.</p>

      <p>Our basic philosophy was that no one goes to work wanting to suck. If you put people in a position to succeed, they will.</p>

      <p>The way a business treats workers, was critical to its success. Within most companies, no matter how great the product or loyal the customers, things would eventually fall apart unless employees trusted one another.</p>

      <p>One of the reasons commitment cultures were successful was because a sense of trust emerged among workers, managers, and customers that enticed everyone to work harder and stick together through the setbacks that are inevitable in any industry. Commitment firms valued making employees happy over quick profits, and as a result, there were higher levels of teamwork and psychological safety.</p>

      <p>There has to be a system in place that makes you trust that you can choose the solution you think is best and that your bosses are committed to supporting you if you take a chance that might not pay off.</p>

      <p>Employees work smarter and better when they believe they have more decision-making authority and when they believe their colleagues are committed to their success. A sense of control can fuel motivation, but for that drive to produce insights and innovations, people need to know their suggestions won't be ignored, that their mistakes won't be held against them. And they need to know that everyone else has their back.</p>

    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      <p>Many of our most important decisions are, in fact, attempts to forecast the future. What fascinated psychologist and economists was how frequently people managed, in the course of their everyday lives, to choose among various futures without becoming paralyzed by the complexities of each choice. What's more, it appeared that some people were more skilled than others at envisioning various future and choosing the best ones for themselves.</p>

      <p>Probabilities can help you forecast likelihood, but they can't guarantee the future. It's normal, of course, to want to know how things will turn out. It's scary when we realized how much rides on choices where we can't predict the future. Making good decision relies on forecasting the future, but forecasting is an imprecise, often terrifying, science because it forces us to confront how much we don't know. The paradox of learning how to make better decisions is that it requires developing a comfort with doubt.</p>

      <p>The lessons on probabilistic thinking instructed participants to think of the future not as what's going to happen, but rather as a series of possibilities that might occur. The goal was to show people how to turn their intuitions into statistical estimates.</p>

      <p>Learning to think probabilistically requires us to question our assumptions and live with uncertainty. To become better at predicting the future, at making good decisions, we need to know the difference between what we hope will happen and what is more and less likely to occur. Probabilities are the closest thing to fortune-telling, but you have to be strong enough to live with what they tell you might occur.</p>

      <p>Even if we have very little data, we can still forecast the future by making assumptions and then skewing them based on what we observe about the world. But it only works if you start with the right assumptions. Our assumptions are based on what we've encountered in life, but our experience often draw on biased sample. In particular, we are much more likely to pay attention to or remember successes and forget about failure.</p>

      <p>Many successful people, spend an enormous amount of time seeking out the information on failure. We all have a natural proclivity to be optimistic, to ignore our mistakes and forget others' tiny errors. But making good predictions relies on realistic assumptions, and those are based on our experience. If we pay attention only to good news, we're handicapping ourselves.</p>

      <p>Making good choices relies on forecasting the future. Accurate forecasting requires exposing ourselves to as many successes and disappointments as possible. The more you force yourself to envision potential futures, the more you learn about which assumptions are certain or flimsy, the better your odds of making a great decision next time.</p>

      <p>You have to be comfortable not knowing exactly where life is going. All we can do is learn how to make the best decisions that are in front of us, and trust that, over time, the odds will be in our favor.</p>

    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      <p>Creative process, taking proven, conventional ideas from other setting and combining them in new ways. Combination of existing material are centerpieces in theories of creativity, whether in the arts, the sciences, or commercial innovations.</p>

      <p>A lot of the people we think of as exceptionally creative are essentially intellectual middlemen. They've learned how to transfer knowledge between different industries or groups. They've seen a lot of different people attack the same problem in different settings, and so they know which kinds of ideas are more likely to work.</p>

      <p>When can create the conditions that help creativity to flourish. We know, for example, that innovation becomes more likely when old ideas are mixed in new ways. We know the odds of success go up when brokers, people with fresh, different perspectives, who have seen ideas in a variety of setting, draw on the diversity within their head.</p>

      <p>If you want to become a broker and increase the productivity of your own creative process. First, be sensitive to your own experience. Pay attention to how things make you think and feel. Second, recognize that the panic and stress you feel as you try to create isn't a sign that everything is falling apart. Rather, it's the condition that help make us flexible enough to seize something new. Finally, remember that the relief accompanying a creative breakthrough, while sweet, can also blind us to seeing alternatives.</p>

      <p>The creative process is, in fact, a process, something that can be broken down and explained. That's important, because it means that anyone can become more creative; we can all become innovation brokers. We all have experience and tools, disturbance and tensions that desperation and upheaval and try to see our old ideas in new ways. We just have to learn how to trust ourselves enough to let the creativity out.</p>

    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      <p>With Google and the internet and all the information we have now, you can find answers to almost anything in seconds, but there's a difference between finding an answer and understanding what it means.</p>

      <p>In the past two decades the amount of information embedded in our daily lives has sky rocketed, if harnessed correctly, data can make our days more productive. In theory, the ongoing explosion in information should make the right answers more obvious. In practice, though, being surrounded by data often makes it harder to decide.</p>

      <p>This inability to take advantage of data as it becomes more plentiful is called "information blindness." This refers to our mind's tendency to stop absorbing data where there's too much to take in.</p>

      <p>Humans are exceptionally good at absorbing information, as long as we can break data into a series of smaller and smaller pieces. This ability to digest large amount of information by breaking it into smaller pieces is how our brains turn information into knowledge.</p>

      <p>One way to overcome information blindness is to force ourselves to grapple with the data in front of us, to manipulate information by transforming it into a sequence of questions to be answered or choices to be made.</p>

      <p>The engineering design process is a series of steps that engineers follow, when they are trying to solve a problem and design a solution for something; it is a methodical approach to problem solving.</p>

      <p>The people who are most successful at learning, those who are able to digest the data surrounding them, who absorb insight embedded in their experiences and take advantage of information flowing past, are the ones who know how to use disfluency to their advantage.</p>

      <p>When we encounter new information and want to learn from it, we should force ourselves to do something with the data. When you find a new piece of information, force yourself to engage with it, to use it in an experiment or describe it to a friend, and then you will start building the mental folders that are at the core of learning.</p>
