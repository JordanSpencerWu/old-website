This book made me reflected on my life. What career am I striving for? Why do I want to become a software engineer? What industry and technologies should I specialize in? We must focus on what career we want to live, most of our time will be spent working for a company or a customer. Our skills and value are our product and we are a business, we are hired to add value to a company. Business is all about making value and satisfying customers.

Most of my life I'm lost, I have no idea what my future looks like and what type of life I want to live. I remember attending college, I was finishing my general studies, and I started thinking about what to major in. Having no idea of what I like and what I am passionate about, I spent months thinking about it. I would lay on my bed thinking about this world I live in instead of going to class. My grade started to take effect of my lost concentration during this time period. This was me, a student with no ambition.

Then one day, I had a dream. In this dream I was holding a piece of paper that had the words "firefighter or engineer". When I woke up, I remember seeing that paper somewhere in my life. After spending time pondering about when and where, I realized it was during a time when I did a career path survey in junior high school. I got those choices because I want to make this world a better place. I decided to major in electrical engineering, it seem interesting and fun. This was the turning point in my life, I was twenty years old and had a goal of graduating in electrical engineering!

First thing I realized was that I was behind! I spent almost two years in college doing general studies. I looked at the pre-engineering course at Salt Lake Community College and signed up eighteen credit hours. I was nervous and afraid, the self-doubt of not being smart enough to graduate in electrical engineering was hard to overcome. I'm a normal student that attend class, takes notes, procrastinate, do homework, and study. This time I had a goal and a different mindset, I realized I was behind and had to work hard to catch up, this motivated me to take more courses.

During this time I learned how to learn by reading textbooks and working on homework assignments. This skill is important, being able to teach yourself, adds value to your personal brand. As we go through school, we always relied on teachers to teach us skills. I wasn't fully aware of this until one day I told my niece I could teach her, she responded with I wasn't her teacher. The best teacher is yourself, you have to believe that you can learn skills on your own. Textbooks and other resources became my source of knowledge. There were times when I didn't attend class because I was confident in learning it on my own. I would continue taking eighteen credit every semester until I graduate in May 2015.

The other turning point in my life was when I first learned about programming in my early twenties. I knew nothing! I had no idea what a Boolean was! I learn everything from reading a textbook, I could create simple programs that solves simple problems. My focus wasn't on becoming a programmer at the time, it was focus on becoming an electrical engineer. It wasn't until my senior year in college when my interest in computer science grew. I started to explore computer science by taking courses on Object Oriented Programming, Data Structure and Algorithms, and Computer Organization. After graduating college, my focus was to become a software engineer.

Why do I want to become a software engineer? I want to be a lifetime learner. Everything about software engineer seem fun and exciting, crafting beautiful software for customers, these software will add value to people's lives. The software industry is constantly changing, it's an industry that I won't be bored in. I have been learning about programming and it's something I'm passionate about, so I decided to invest in becoming a software engineer.

> If your life is primary consumed by your work, then loving your work is one of the most important keys to loving your life.

When I look at software engineer jobs posting today, most of them are for web development. The current trends are creating responsive web applications, everyone has a cellphone that has access to the web. It's easy to open up a browser and go to your favorite website. There's a lot of value in web development, this is the best medium for business to get customers. One important aspect of development is selecting the technologies for building them. Picking the technologies to invest in will impact your product, which is your skills and knowledge.

Another important aspect of becoming a software engineer is to pick a business domain. It's important to choose an industry or company, you want to learn more than just coding, learn about the industry/business you work in. This will give you more value to the company and industry. The web development industry seem like a great place to invest my skills in, I enjoy learning about front-end and back-end of web applications. What I like most about this industry is the technologies are always changing and working with other teammates that shares the same passion.

The book talked about thinking like a winner, winner only think about winning. With this mindset we are able to set goals and will be determined to achieve them. Business wants to hire people who finish things! Keep practicing and stretch your limits! Practicing means to do something we haven't done before, if your code doesn't look perfect this means you doing it right, if your code is perfect this means you’re not stretching your limits. Try something new! Like exploring existing code in open source project, this allows you to learn from reading other professional's code.

It's easy to focus on our long-term goals, but remember to set short-term goals and focus on the present. You have control over your present self, think about what you can change and improve each day that will help the future you reach that long-term goal. Remember winners takes calculated risk. When setting your career goals, remind yourself that your job title isn't your product. The company's position doesn't define your skills set. It's important to never be comfortable at your current position. Continue adding values to your product, there's no such thing as job security in this ever changing world.

> Market yourself! Let people know you exist and that you can solve problems!

Marketing your brand is important! Your brand is your name, never tarnish your brand! Be a doer whenever you say you would do something, this will give you credibility by doing the task on time. Let people judge you based on your abilities, your goodness at your company is subjective, always measured based on someone else's perception of you. Remember that managers and customers are afraid of you because you're smart. Your technical writing skills are the most important skill that employers look at, you are what you can explain.

Start planning your goals, planning is the first step to executing your goals, make a to-do list every day, once you get good start plan weekly then work your way up to monthly. The secret is to focus on whatever it is you’re trying to improve better than it was yesterday. Use incremental changes to get you closer each day towards your goals. To have a remarkable life you must invest in your product and to plan it!
