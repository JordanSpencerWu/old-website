To become a software craftsman you must value your craft, practicing disciplines that will help you create clean code. It's about continuous improvement and learning, a belief that you can be better and everything can be improved if you're prepared to work at it, "effort is what makes you smart and talented". Always adapting and changing based on the feedback you get from the world around you. Willingness to teach and share your knowledge to others who are willing to learn. We believe that we are all on the same journey and that the change we seek is in ourselves, not the world. This means to walk The Long Road, a lifelong journey of learning.

This book talks about software craftsman's paths to mastering their craft. Many similar paths taken by craftsman, the book calls this apprenticeship pattern. It's about drawing your own map, a map that will help guide you towards mastery. It's our responsibility to learn to grow ourselves. This focus on yourself and your need to grow is the essence of what it means to be an apprentice.

##### Emptying the Cup

There will be times when we think we know everything and are experts at a particular topic or field, a metaphor for this will be a cup that is full. To become an apprentice you must first empty your cup so that you can fill it with new skills. The best way to learn these new skills is by being in the same room with people who are trying to achieve some goal using the skills you wish to learn. Be the worst on your team will help you learn quicker, think about the sink or swim strategy. Emptying your cup means to be willing to learn new skills.

##### Walking the Long Road

This will be a lifelong journey, as soon as a person stops practicing, her/his mastery fades. Your goal is to measure your abilities and find ways to be better than you were yesterday. Software development is composed of two primary activities: learning and communication. Learning is a perpetual activity for those on the The Long Road to mastery. Remember that you are walking The Long Road, and this journey is not a sprint. People who walk the Long Road are people moving at a sustainable pace for decades.

##### Accurate Self-Assessment

Part of this journey is finding mentors with skills you want to acquire. These kindred spirits will help guide you by sharing their knowledge and skills. There are many kindred spirits around the world and in your community that you can reach out to. Continue to evaluate your current skills with skills you want to acquire and check your road map to see if you're on track. Take the time to get the most out of your apprenticeship, and understand that whether you have been programming for three months or five years, you are still very much a beginner when it comes to software craftsmanship.

##### Perpetual Learning

The core theme of an apprenticeship is learning and the dominant trait of a successful apprentice is a demonstration of her/his learning abilities. Like everything in life you must practice to get better. One way to practice is by creating Breakable Toys, failure is often the best way to learn anything. Seek out other people's code and read it, a good place will be the open source world. Only by reading the code can one truly understand a system. Lastly, it's important to record what your learned and to share it with others.

##### Construct Your Curriculum

There is no assigned reading, it's up to you to find recommendations and construct your own curriculum. Create your own reading list of books, maintain a list to track the books you plan to read and to remember the books you've read. Decide what your next book will be, keep up the momentum after you've finished a book. You need to become an active participant in your ongoing self-education and construct your curriculum. Learning to enjoy the learning process itself will serve you well in the ever-changing technology landscape that keeps us perpetually on our toes.
