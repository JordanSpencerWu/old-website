description: We are the creatures of habit. Once we are aware of them, then we're able to take control and make changes to improve our lives. To do this we must understand the habit loop, A cue or a trigger followed by a routine, and then lastly the reward. Habits can be changed, if we understand how they work.

Habit: the choices that all of us deliberately make at some point, and then stop thinking about but continue doing, often every day.

The process in which the brain converts a sequence of actions into an automatic routine is known as "chunking", and it's at the root of how habits form.

Habit process within our brains is a three-step loop. First, there is a <b>cue</b>, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit is use. Then there is the <b>routine</b>, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a <b>reward</b>, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future. Over time this loop becomes more and more automatic and a habit is born.

Habits can be ignored, changed, or replaced.

When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making.

Habits are so powerful, they create neurological craving.

This is how new habits are created: by putting together a cue, a routine, and a reward, and then cultivating a craving that drives the loop.

Golden Rule of habit change, you must keep the old cue, and deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine. If you use the same cue, and provide the same reward, you can shift the routine and change the habit.

Belief is the ingredient that made a reworked habit loop into a permanent behavior. We do know that for habits to permanently change, people must believe that change is feasible.

If you want to change a habit, you must find an alternative routine, and your odds of success go up dramatically when you commit to changing as part of a group.

Keystone habits say that success doesn't depend on getting single thing right, but instead relies on identifying a few key priorities and fashioning them into powerful levers. Small wins are exactly what they sound like, and are part of how keystone habits create widespread changes. "Once a small win has been accomplished, forces are set in motion that favor another small win." The second way that keystone encourage habits change: by creating structures that help other habits to flourish. The final way that keystone habits encourage widespread change: by creating cultures where new values become ingrained.

The habits that matter most are the ones that, when they start to shift, dislodge and remake other patterns.

Willpower is the single most important keystone habit for individual success. Willpower is a learnable skill.

This is how willpower becomes a habit: by choosing a certain behavior ahead of time, and then following that routine when an inflection point arrives.

"People want to be in control of their lives."

Organizational habit offer a basic promise: If you follow the established patterns and abide by the truce, then rivalries won't destroy the company, the profits will roll in, and, eventually, everyone will get rich.

Habits are unique to each person.

People's buying habits are more likely to change when they go through a major life event.

If you dress a new something in old habits, it's easier for the public to accept it.

Our weak-tie acquaintances are often as influential, if not more, than our close-tie friends.

For an idea to grow beyond a community, it must become self-propelling.

Habit reigned supreme, the behaviors that occur unthinkingly are the evidence of our truest selves.

We can choose our habits, once we know how. Everything we know about habits is that any of them can be changed, if you understand how they function. However, to modify a habit, you must decide to change it. We know bad habits exist and once you understand that habits can change, you have the freedom and responsibility to remake them.

The will to believe is the most important ingredient in creating belief in change and that one of the most important methods for creating that belief was habits.

<blockquote>
  Once we choose who we want to be, people grow to the way in which they have been exercised, just as sheet of paper or a coat, once creased or folded, tends to fall forever afterward into the same identical folds.
</blockquote>

if you believe you can change, if you make it a habit, the change becomes real. This is the real power of habit: the insight that your habits are what you choose them to be.

The way we habitually think of our surroundings and ourselves create the worlds that each of us inhabit.

<blockquote>
  There are these two-young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says 'Morning boys. How's the water?' And the two-young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes 'What the hell is water?'
</blockquote>

The water is habits, the unthinking choices and invisible decisions that surrounds us every day and which, just by looking at them, become visible again.

Every habit abides by a set of rules, and when you understand those codes you gain influence over them. Any habit can be changed.
